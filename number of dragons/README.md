This is a problem I got from a friend studying at IIITH.  
The problem goes like this:  
1.There are initially 2 dragons on an island.    
2.After 2 years, they give birth to a pair of dragons.    
3.The newborn dragons, after 2 years give birth to another pair of dragons.. and so on.  
4.But, after giving birth for the first time, any given dragon pair will give birth to a pair of dragons every year hence.  

The function takes number of years from user input and displays the number of dragons at that point of time.  

For example,  
input: 3  
output: 6  
explanation: After 2 years, the first pair will have given birth to another pair. Hence, the number of dragons would be 4.    
After another year, the first pair will give birth to another pair(check point 4 above), hence the total number of dragons    
6 after 3 years




The problem has been solved here by using recursive functions. An interesting observation is that the series of answers  
for consecutive years is twice the value of the terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

This code prints a number pattern as shown:

1  
2 3  
4 5 6  
7 8 9 10...  

The number of rows is taken as user input.

The concept used is mathematical and logic based. A variable(k) is defined such that it is 1 less than the first 
element of that row. 

Then each row is printed so that the numbers appear as shown above
